# Agentic Setup Framework (Completely User-Specific)
# ========================================================
# NOTHING from the agentic setup framework should be in version control.
# This is a personal development tool - each developer installs it separately.
#
# Why user-specific?
# - Each developer may want different agents enabled
# - Agent sensitivity settings may vary by developer preference
# - Allows experimentation without affecting the team
# - No version control conflicts or noise
#
# Installation:
# 1. Clone the framework separately:
#    git clone https://github.com/yourorg/agentic-setup ~/agentic-setup
#
# 2. Run installer in your project:
#    cd your-project
#    python ~/agentic-setup/scripts/implement_framework.py .
